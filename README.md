<h5 style="margin-top:120px;">Grilled chicken</h5>

  <hr>

  <p style = "font-size:18px;">An oven is a dry heat source used to cook the chicken. It adds no flavour. All flavour comes from the seasoning used.A grill adds flavour during cooking. If the heat source is wood or charcoal you add a smokey flavour on top of whatever seasoning you used. Even a propane grill adds a little flavour from the grease dripping into the flame. If you let the chicken get a few charred spots thatâ€™s another level.As you can see grilled chicken just has more depth of flavour so is better.</p>
